Question:-
The MovieTestDrive class creates objects (instances) of the Movie class and uses the dot operator (.) to set the
instance variables to a specific value. The MovieTest-Drive class also invokes (calls) a method on one of the
objects. Fill in the chart to the right with the values the three objects have at the end of main().

class Movie {
String title;
String genre;
int rating;
void playIt() {
System.out.println("Playing the movie");
}
}
public class MovieTestDrive {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Movie one = new Movie();
one.title = "Gone with the Stock";
one.genre = "Tragic";
one.rating = -2;
Movie two = new Movie();
two.title = "Lost in Cubicle Space";
two.genre = "Comedy";
two.rating = 5;
two.playIt();
Movie three = new Movie();
three.title = "Byte Club";
three.genre = "Tragic but ultimately uplifting";
three.rating = 127;
}
}
