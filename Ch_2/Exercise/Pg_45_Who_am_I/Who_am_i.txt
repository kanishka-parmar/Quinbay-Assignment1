//Who AM I
Question:-
A bunch of Java components, in full costume, are playing a party
game, “Who am I?” They give you a clue, and you try to guess who
they are, based on what they say. Assume they always tell the truth
about themselves. If they happen to say something that could be
true for more than one of them, choose all for whom that sentence
can apply. Fill in the blanks next to the sentence with the names of
one or more attendees. The first one’s on us.
Tonight’s attendees:
