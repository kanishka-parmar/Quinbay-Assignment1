//Question:-
/*
 Each of the Java files on this page represents a complete source file.
Your job is to play compiler and determine whether each of these files 
will compile. If they wonâ€™t compile, how would you fix them, and if 
they do compile, what would be their output?

A 
class StreamingSong {
String title;
String artist;
int duration;
void play() {
System.out.println("Playing song");
}
void printDetails() {
System.out.println("This is " + title +
" by " + artist);
}
}
class StreamingSongTestDrive {
public static void main(String[] args) {
song.artist = "The Beatles";
song.title = "Come Together";
song.play();
song.printDetails();
}
}
*/

//Solution:-
/*
No the above program will not compile successfully because object is not created. So we need to create object:- StreamingSong song = new StreamingSong();
Below code will run successfully 
 */
public class StreamingSongTestDrive {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamingSong song = new StreamingSong();
        song.artist = "The Beatles";
        song.title = "Come Together";
        song.play();
        song.printDetails();
    }
}
class StreamingSong {
    String title;
    String artist;
    int duration;

    void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing song");
    }

    void printDetails() {
        System.out.println("This is " + title +
                " by " + artist);
    }
}



//Output:-
/*
