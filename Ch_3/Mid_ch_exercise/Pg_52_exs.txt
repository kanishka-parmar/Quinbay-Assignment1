Question:-The compiler won’t let you put a value from a large cup into
a small one. But what about the other way—pouring a
small cup into a big one? No problem.Based on what you know about the size
and type of the primitive variables, see if you can figure out which of these
are legal and which aren’t.We haven’t covered all the
rules yet, so on some of these you’ll have to use your best
judgment. Tip: The compiler always errs on the side of safety.

From the following list, Circle the statements that would be
legal if these lines were in a single method:

1. int x = 34.5;     -->  Illegal
2. boolean boo = x;  -->  Illegal
3. int g = 17;       -->  Legal
4. int y = g;        -->  Legal
5. y = y + 10;       -->  Legal
6. short s;          -->  Legal
7. s = y;            -->  Illegal
8. byte b = 3;       -->  Legal
9. byte v = b;       -->  Legal
10. short n = 12;    -->  Legal
11. v = n;           -->  Illegal
12. byte k = 128;    -->  Illegal
