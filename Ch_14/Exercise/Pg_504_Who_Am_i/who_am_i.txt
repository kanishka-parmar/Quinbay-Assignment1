Question:-
A bunch of Java hotshots, in full costume, are playing the party game “Who
am I?” They give you a clue, and you try to guess who they are, based on
what they say. Assume they always tell the truth about themselves. If they
happen to say something that could be true for more than one guy, then
write down all for whom that sentence applies. Fill in the blanks next to the
sentence with the names of one or more attendees.

Solution:-

1.)I got the whole GUI, in my hands.                  --> JFrame                               

2.)Every event type has one of these.                 --> listener interface                 

3.)The listener’s key method.                         --> actionPerformed()

4.)This method gives JFrame its size.                 --> setsize()

5.)You add code to this method but never call it.     -->paintComponent()

6.)When the user actually does something, it’s an.    -->event

7.)Most of these are event sources.                   -->swing components

8.)I carry data back to the listener.                 --> event object

9.)An addXxxListener( ) method says an object is an.  --> event source

10.)How a listener signs up.                          --> addXxxListener

11.)The method where all the graphics code goes.      --> paintComponent()

12.)I’m typically bound to an instance.               --> inner class

13.)The “g” in (Graphics g) is really of this class.  -->Graphics2D

14.)The method that gets paintComponent( ) rolling.   -->repaint()

15.)The package where most of the Swingers reside.    -->javax.swing
