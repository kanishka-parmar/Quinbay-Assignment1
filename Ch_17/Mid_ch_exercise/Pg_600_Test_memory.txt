Question:-
Test your memory of the classes for reading and writing from a SocketChannel. Try not to look at the opposite page!

==>To read text from a SocketChannel:

Solution:-
InetSocketAddress serverAddr = new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 5000);
SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open(serverAddr);
Reader reader = Channels.newReader(socketChannel, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(reader);
String message = bufferedReader.readLine();
 

==>To send text to a SocketChannel:

Solution:-
InetSocketAddress serverAddr = new InetSocketAddress("127.0.0.1", 5000);
SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open(serverAddr);
Writer writer = Channels.newWriter(socketChannel, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(writer);
writer.println("message to send");
writer.print("another message");
