Question:-
A bunch of Java and network terms, in full costume, are playing a party game, “Who am I?” They’ll give you a clue—you try to
guess who they are based on what they say. Assume they always tell the truth about themselves. If they happen to say something
that could be true for more than one attendee, then write down all for whom that sentence applies. Fill in the blanks next to the
sentence with the names of one or more attendees.

Tonight’s attendees:
InetSocketAddress, SocketChannel, IP address, host name, port, Socket, ServerSocketChannel, Thread, thread pool, Executors, 
ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, Runnable, InterruptedException, Thread.sleep()

Solution:-

1.)I need to be shut down or I might live forever                ---> ExecutorService

2.)I let you talk to a remote machine                            ---> Socket Channel, Socket                        

3.)I might be thrown by sleep() and await()                      ---> InterruptedException

4.)If you want to reuse Threads, you should use me               ---> Thread pool, ExecutorService

5.)You need to know me if you want to connect to another machine ---> IP Address, Host name, port

6.)I’m like a separate process running on the machine            ---> Thread

7.)I can give you the ExecutorService you need                   ---> Executors

8.)You need one of me if you want clients to connect to me       ---> ServerSocketChannel

9.)I can help you make your multithreaded code more predictable  ---> Thread.sleep(),CountDownLatch

10.)I represent a job to run                                     ---> Runnable

11.)I store the IP address and port of the server                ---> InetSocketAddress
