Question:-
How could you sort the songs differently?
Write lambda expressions to sort the songs in these ways:-
▪ Sort by BPM
▪ Sort by title in descending order

Solution:-

▪ Sort by BPM
  songList.sort((one, two) -> one.getBPM().compareTo(two.getBPM()));


▪ Sort by title in descending order
  songList.sort((one, two) -> two.getTitle().compareTo(one.getTitle()));
