Quest:- Try to guess what each line of code is doing...
Solution:-

int size = 27;
--> declare an integer variable named ‘size’ and give it the value 27

String name = "Fido";
--> declare a string variable named ‘name’ and give it the value "Fido"

Dog myDog = new Dog(name, size);
--> declare a new Dog variable named ‘myDog’ and make it use name and size

x = size - 5;
--> Subtract 5 from size and assign it to variable named x

if (x < 15) myDog.bark(8);
--> It is a condition if x is less than 15 then tell the dog to bark 8 times


while (x > 3) {
--> it is a loop codition wich tells to keep looping  until x is greater than 3

myDog.play();
--> This tells the dog to play

}
--> end of loop


int[] numList = {2, 4, 6, 8};
--> Declare an array of integers named "numList" and put 2,4,6,8 into the numList

System.out.print("Hello");
--> Print out "Hello"

System.out.print("Dog: " + name);
--> Print out "Dog: Fido"

String num = "8";
--> declare a string variable named ‘num’ and give it the value "8"

int z = Integer.parseInt(num);
--> Typecasting ie convert the string variable num into actual numerical value

try {
--> try block

readTheFile("myFile.txt");
--> read the text file named "myFile.txt"

}
--> end of try block

catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {
--> catch block if thigns dont work in try block

System.out.print("File not found.");
--> print "File Not Found"

}
--> end of catch block
