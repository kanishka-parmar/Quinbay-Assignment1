Question:-
On the left you’ll find sets of class diagrams. Your job is to
turn these into valid Java declarations. We did number 1 for
you (and it was a tough one).

What’s the Declaration ?
Solution:-

1.) public class Click {}
    public class Clack extends Click {}

2.) public abstract class Top {}
    public class Tip extends Top {}

3.) public abstract class Fee {}
    public abstract class Fi extends Fee {}

4.) public interface Foo{}
    public class Bar implements Foo{}
    public class Baz extends Bar{}

5.) public interface Zeta {}
    public class Alpha implements Zeta {}
    public interface Beta {}
    public class Delta extends Alpha implements Beta {}
