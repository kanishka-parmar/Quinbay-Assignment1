Question:-
We built the test class and the SimpleStartup class. But we still haven’t made the
actual game. Given the code on the opposite page and the spec for the actual
game, write in your ideas for prep code for the game class. We’ve given you a few
lines here and there to get you started. The actual game code is on the next page,
so don’t turn the page until you do this exercise!
You should have somewhere between 12 and 18 lines (including the ones we wrote,
but not including lines that have only a curly brace).

The SimpleStartupGame
needs to do this:
1. Make the singleSimpleStartup object.
2. Make a location for it (three consecutive cells on a single row of seven virtual cells).
3. Ask the user for a guess.
4. Check the guess.
5. Repeat until the Startup is sunk.
6. Tell the user how many guesses it took.

Output:-
%java SimpleStartupGame
enter a number 2
hit
enter a number 3
hit
enter a number 4
miss
enter a number 1
kill
You took 4 guesses


METHOD public static void main (String [] args)
   DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses, named numOfGuesses
   


   COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position



   WHILE the Startup is still alive:
        GET user input from the command line

Solution:-
METHOD public static void main (String [] args)
   DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of user guesses, named numOfGuesses
   Create a new SimpleStartup object

   COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position
   Make an int array with randomly generated no and then incrementing the no by 1 and 2
   Call the setLocationCells() method on SimpleStartup object
   Declare a boolean variablenames isAlive and set it to TRUE 


   WHILE the Startup is still alive:
        GET user input from the command line
        Call the checkYourself() metod on SimpleStartup instance
        Increment numOfGuesses
        Check for Startup death ie if result=="kill"
        Set isAlive to FALSE
        Print the numberof user guesses
