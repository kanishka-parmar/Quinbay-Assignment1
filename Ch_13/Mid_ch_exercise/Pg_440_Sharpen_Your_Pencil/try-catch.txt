Question
Your task is to create two different legal try/catch structures (similar to the
one above left) to accurately represent the class diagram shown on the
left. Assume ALL of these exceptions might be thrown by the method with
the try block.

Solution:-
1.)

try {
x.doRisky();
} catch(BoinkEx a) {
// recovery from BoinkEx
} catch(BiffEx b) {
// recovery from BiffEx
} catch(BarEx c) {
// recovery from BarEx
} catch(FooEx d) {
// recovery from FooEx
} catch(BazEx e) {
// recovery from BazEx
}
 

2.)
try {
x.doRisky();
catch(BiffEx b) {
// recovery from BiffEx
} catch(BarEx c) {
// recovery from BarEx
} catch(FooEx d) {
// recovery from FooEx
} catch(BazEx e) {
// recovery from BazEx
}
